5: Standardization enables creativity

Shipping containers are a great analogy: A simple idea who revolutionized logistics.

But the success of shipping containers only existed when the whole supply chain WAS adapted for them:
• Ships design
	• cranes
	• trucks

Inconstitency truly degrades the benefits of note taking.
Either because of where we take them:
				- in the margin
				- in a notebook
				- in An App
On about what we take them:
				- with a different context
				- on objective each time

Having many kind of notes in many kind of places only leaves us with the massive project of collecting and organizing them before being able to use them.

Notes are shopping containers for ideas, and what even they ane about should be handled in the same way.


Every steps of the note taking process should take as little efforts as necessary. It is from the process structure that these small efforts are maximised.

Writing a paper, the easy steps:
	- wrote down notes
	- makes an outline of the sequence of ideas from notes
	- complete the leaps into a rough draft
	- polish it into a paper.

They require different skills, which gets better by separating these steps
