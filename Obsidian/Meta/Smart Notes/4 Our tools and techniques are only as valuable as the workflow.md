4: Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow

- The slip-box isn't another technique,it is a system, a system in which all of the techniques are linked together.

- Good systems do not add options & features, they strip away complexity & distraction from the main work

- tips & tricks: outline, 3- paragraph structure, repeat main point, vivid examples, set a timer,...
do not make sense in isolation, but only as the system they form together
